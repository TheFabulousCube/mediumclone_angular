## Description

My implementation of the **RealWorld** specs, as taught through the Udemy course [Angular and NgRx - Building Real Project From Scratch
](https://www.udemy.com/course/angular-and-ngrx-building-real-project-from-scratch)

This course was based on building the [RealWorld](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/docs/intro) demo. Specifically adhering to the [frontend specs](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/docs/specs/frontend-specs/templates). This was really nice since it really gave you a chance to build something more that an simple 'to do' application.

This course is the front end for the **RealWorld** application and compliments [NestJS - Building Real Project API From Scratch](https://www.udemy.com/course/nestjs-building-real-project-api-from-scratch) nicely!

I'm still working on this course, I'll update this document as I go.

### What I liked about the course

- Again, lots of 'production ready' tips

### What I didn't like about the course

- NgRx store is complicated, but that's one of the reasons I took the course

### What I changed

- Just like in the backend, I started moving string literals to constants

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component <component-name> --flat --standalone` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`. This will scaffoled out a new component in the current directory along with test files. The standalone flag uses a template for standalone componenets and skips the .module file.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
